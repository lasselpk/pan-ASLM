# pan-ASLM: A high resolution and large field of view light sheet microscope for expansion microscopy
This GitHub page covers the code required for the pan-ASLM microscope described in *“pan-ASLM: A high resolution and large field of view light sheet microscope for expansion microscopy”*  
by H. Mekbib et al., submitted to BioRxiv (2025). https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.08.06.668765 . The microscope is controlled using LabVIEW 2020 

# Software Interface
The interface allows to setup acquisition of up to 4 lasers and selecting the number of images to be acquired in XYZ.
